    <h2 id="whatt">What is it?</h2>
    <p id="what-is-it">
        Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a
        specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling
        algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming
        language (commonly referred to as coding). <br /> <a target="_blank"

    <h2 id="historry">The History</h2>
    <p id="history">The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and
        1945. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his
        PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN; developed in 1956 by a team led by John
        Backus at IBM. <br /> <a target="_blank"

    <h2 id="html">The Languages</h2>
    <p id="learn">There are thousands of coding languages in existence today. Some of these are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="wow">JavaScript</li>
        <li class="wow">Python</li>
        <li class="wow">SQL</li>
        <li class="wow">PHP</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="history">And many, many more. <br /> <a
